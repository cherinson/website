             This first week of engineering i learned different rules on how to be safe to protect ourselves and others.I learned that
             safety goggles and putting your hair up is essential when working with equipments and tools. We were also challenged to work
             with others to solve a problem. Our goal was to get a marble in a bucket using pipes but it was going too fast for us to
             control the marble. By working together, we figured out we had straighted the pipes so our marble's speed decreased. By doing 
             that, our marble went all the way passed the bucket. Now we had to figure out how to get the marble into the bucket which we 
             got close to making it by lowering our sticks.

             <p>8/28-8/31 Week2<br>
            My second week of engineering, i learned about mechanical engineering and how broad it can be. I also learned the different tools
            engineers use and some different types of orginizations like (SAE). We also started working on our designs for the rube goldberg machine.
            As my team started desgining, we stumbled on a problem of how we can pull the pulley because it was in the middle of our desgin and 
            we werent aloud to touch it after it started. Our solution to that was starting off with the pulley so we didnt have to worry about 
            pulling it later on. On thursady, we did a challenge using tinkercad to make a home appliance. It was a bit difficult because every 
            move had to be percise and since it wasnt something i was used to using often. My biggest challenge was making the number small enough 
            so i could fit it where the degree of the oven was supposed to go. After working with it a little, I got the hang of it and figured out 
            that I had to zoom in a lot to move it very percisely to where it fit perfectly.

            <p>9/5-9/8 Week 3<br> 
            This third week of intro to engineering, we went more indepth on hands on projects. We finished up our tinkerCAD designs of our Rube
            Goldberg machine so we could start building it next time. During the tinkerCAD we worked hard on our desgins and I think it turned 
            out very nice. We added the last finishing details on our machine and submitted it. On thursday, we began building our desings
            with cardboard. We started off sketching the ramp because that was the first step of our machine. When I tried cutting the cardboard
            with the exacto knife, it was kind of difficult cutting in a straight line. As a solution, I used the ruler to try and cut more 
            precisely which helped tremendously. I also started working on our lever which is for our car to go onto. I enjoyed working with my
            team to help build the Rube Goldberg machine and I am very excited contribute my best effort to finish it.

             <p>9/11-9/14 Week 4<br>
             In my fourth week of engineering, we finsihed building our rube goldberg machines. I mainly worked on the lever for our machine. I built
             a triangle for the base of the lever by bending a piece of cardboard three times then taping it to my desired shape of the triangle. 
             Then I taped a peice of flat cardboard on top of the traingle for the top base. After completing the lever, I moved on to making the legs 
             for our start peice of the machine which was the incline. After we finished attaching our finishing touches, we tested it with the ballon. 
             The problem was that it had not enough force to actually pop the ballon. So, we decided to make the ballon way bigger and push our lever a 
             bit back so there will be more force. After a couple of tries, the ballon popped and our project was finished.

             <p> 9/18-9/21 Week 5<br>
             My fifth week of engineering, we were challenged to build a floating device from paper to hold weights on top water. The biggest challenge 
             I had was thinking about a design to build my boat. I decided to make a tiny box that had 2 layers of paper on the bottom. My weight was 
             74.2 grams and we went outside to test it. Before I put my boat in the water, I made sure to level out the weights evenly so it wouldnt
             tilt. After putting my boat into the water, it was floating and looking good, but after about two and a half minutes, it started to sink. 
             I think I could've taken out some weight to make it float for the whole 5 minutes. Another challenge we did was the "E" challenge. We had 
             to design an E and put the exact measurements so another person can make an exact copy of it. Using someone else's measurements to design 
             the E was pretty easy because they had very percise measurements to follow. These challenges helped me learn that measurements are very 
             important when designing.

            <p> 9/25-9/29 Week 6<br>
            This week we learned the basics of computer architecture and computer engineering. On tuesday, my group and I dissected a computer to see
            all the different parts inside of it. We were challenged to take it all apart and put it back together. It was really interesting to see 
            inside of something I use everyday. There were so many little buttons, wires, and sections for different parts which were very fascinating.
            Our group were missing some of the peices but we still had a lot of fun and learned a lot from dissecting a computer.

            <P> 10/2-10/6 Week 7<br>
            My seventh week of engineering, we had a lecture on bio engineering which I thought was something that is very helful to our world. I thought
            the artfical heart was very cool because it can help so many people. Prosthetics was a big part of bio engineering as it lets both humans and 
            animals have a part of themselves that they were missing. Then we were challenged to make our own prosthetic hand that would lift a water 
            bottle. My group made our hand with 4 fingers and a thumb and we used strings and a rubber band to help pull the fingers together to grip the
            bottle. On thursday, we used tinkercad to make any prosthetic for an animal. I made a prosthetic tale for a dolphin for dolphins with amputated
            tales.

            <p>10/9-10/13 Week 8<br>
            In my seventh week of engineering, I learned a lot on aerospace engineering which encompasses the test of aircrafts such as rockets, spacecrafts, 
            missiles, and much more. Today, the focus of aerospace engineering revolves around the advancements of space exploration and defense systems. We 
            learn all this information from different forces to diffrent aerospace companies like Nasa. We also designed our own rocket on tinker cad for our 
            experiment with coke bottles which we have to make into rockets. I made my design pretty simple but made sure it had all the parts of a rocket.
            I learned a lot this week and can not wait to see the experiment next week.

            In my 10th week of engineering, I learned a lot about environmental engineering. I learned that it uses both science and engineering to improve the
            natural enviornment. Environmental engineering  provides fresh water, air, and land for all living organisms including us humans, animals, and plants. 
            By using this information we had a challenge to take dirty water and try to purify it to clean water by using materials like cotton balls, sand, pebbles,
            big rocks, and a coke bottle. My partner and I decided to layer the materials in the order of cotton balls on the bottom,sand, pebbles, then the big rocks.
            Our water wasnt super clear but it definitely got cleaner than before. It was very interesting to try and purify dirty water which is probably done every 
            second in this world to provide us with clean water to drink and use.
