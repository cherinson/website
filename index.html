             This first week of engineering i learned different rules on how to be safe to protect ourselves and others.I learned that
             safety goggles and putting your hair up is essential when working with equipments and tools. We were also challenged to work
             with others to solve a problem. Our goal was to get a marble in a bucket using pipes but it was going too fast for us to
             control the marble. By working together, we figured out we had straighted the pipes so our marble's speed decreased. By doing 
             that, our marble went all the way passed the bucket. Now we had to figure out how to get the marble into the bucket which we 
             got close to making it by lowering our sticks.

             <p>8/28-8/31 Week2<br>
            My second week of engineering, i learned about mechanical engineering and how broad it can be. I also learned the different tools
            engineers use and some different types of orginizations like (SAE). We also started working on our designs for the rube goldberg machine.
            As my team started desgining, we stumbled on a problem of how we can pull the pulley because it was in the middle of our desgin and 
            we werent aloud to touch it after it started. Our solution to that was starting off with the pulley so we didnt have to worry about 
            pulling it later on. On thursady, we did a challenge using tinkercad to make a home appliance. It was a bit difficult because every 
            move had to be percise and since it wasnt something i was used to using often. My biggest challenge was making the number small enough 
            so i could fit it where the degree of the oven was supposed to go. After working with it a little, I got the hang of it and figured out 
            that I had to zoom in a lot to move it very percisely to where it fit perfectly.

            <p>9/5-9/8 Week 3<br> 
            This third week of intro to enginering, we went more indepth on hands on projects. We finished up our tinkerCAD designs of our Rube
            Goldberg machine so we could start building it next time. During the tinkerCAD we worked hard on our desgins and I think it turned 
            out very nice. We added the last finishing details on our machine and submitted it. On thursday, we began building our desings
            with cardboard. We started off sketching the ramp because that was the first step of our machine. When I tried cutting the cardboard
            with the exacto knife, it was kind of difficult cutting in a straight line. As a solution, I used the ruler to try and cut more 
            precisely which helped tremendously. I also started working on our lever which is for our car to go onto. I enjoyed working with my
            team to help build the Rube Goldberg machine and I am very excited contribute my best effort to finish it.
