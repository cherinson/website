             This first week of engineering i learned different rules on how to be safe to protect ourselves and others.I learned that
             safety goggles and putting your hair up is essential when working with equipments and tools. We were also challenged to work
             with others to solve a problem. Our goal was to get a marble in a bucket using pipes but it was going too fast for us to
             control the marble. By working together, we figured out we had straighted the pipes so our marble's speed decreased. By doing 
             that, our marble went all the way passed the bucket. Now we had to figure out how to get the marble into the bucket which we 
             got close to making it by lowering our sticks.

             <p>8/28-8/31 Week2<br>
             My second week of engineering, i learned about mechanical engineering and how broad it can be. I also learned the different tools
             engineers use and some different types of orginizations like (SAE). We also started working on our designs for the rube goldberg machine.
             As my team started desgining, we stumbled on a problem of how we can pull the pulley because it was in the middle of our desgin and 
             we werent aloud to touch it after it started. Our solution to that was starting off with the pulley so we didnt have to worry about 
             pulling it later on. On thursady, we did a challenge using tinkercad to make a home appliance. It was a bit difficult because every 
             move had to be percise and since it wasnt something i was used to using often. My biggest challenge was making the number small enough 
             so i could fit it where the degree of the oven was supposed to go. After working with it a little, I got the hang of it and figured out 
             that I had to zoom in a lot to move it very percisely to where it fit perfectly.

             <p>9/5-9/8 Week 3<br> 
             This third week of intro to engineering, we went more indepth on hands on projects. We finished up our tinkerCAD designs of our Rube
             Goldberg machine so we could start building it next time. During the tinkerCAD we worked hard on our desgins and I think it turned 
             out very nice. We added the last finishing details on our machine and submitted it. On thursday, we began building our desings
             with cardboard. We started off sketching the ramp because that was the first step of our machine. When I tried cutting the cardboard
             with the exacto knife, it was kind of difficult cutting in a straight line. As a solution, I used the ruler to try and cut more 
             precisely which helped tremendously. I also started working on our lever which is for our car to go onto. I enjoyed working with my
             team to help build the Rube Goldberg machine and I am very excited contribute my best effort to finish it.

             <p>9/11-9/14 Week 4<br>
             In my fourth week of engineering, we finsihed building our rube goldberg machines. I mainly worked on the lever for our machine. I built
             a triangle for the base of the lever by bending a piece of cardboard three times then taping it to my desired shape of the triangle. 
             Then I taped a peice of flat cardboard on top of the traingle for the top base. After completing the lever, I moved on to making the legs 
             for our start peice of the machine which was the incline. After we finished attaching our finishing touches, we tested it with the ballon. 
             The problem was that it had not enough force to actually pop the ballon. So, we decided to make the ballon way bigger and push our lever a 
             bit back so there will be more force. After a couple of tries, the ballon popped and our project was finished.

             <p> 9/18-9/21 Week 5<br>
             My fifth week of engineering, we were challenged to build a floating device from paper to hold weights on top water. The biggest challenge 
             I had was thinking about a design to build my boat. I decided to make a tiny box that had 2 layers of paper on the bottom. My weight was 
             74.2 grams and we went outside to test it. Before I put my boat in the water, I made sure to level out the weights evenly so it wouldnt
             tilt. After putting my boat into the water, it was floating and looking good, but after about two and a half minutes, it started to sink. 
             I think I could've taken out some weight to make it float for the whole 5 minutes. Another challenge we did was the "E" challenge. We had 
             to design an E and put the exact measurements so another person can make an exact copy of it. Using someone else's measurements to design 
             the E was pretty easy because they had very percise measurements to follow. These challenges helped me learn that measurements are very 
             important when designing.

             <p> 9/25-9/29 Week 6<br>
             This week we learned the basics of computer architecture and computer engineering. On tuesday, my group and I dissected a computer to see
             all the different parts inside of it. We were challenged to take it all apart and put it back together. It was really interesting to see 
             inside of something I use everyday. There were so many little buttons, wires, and sections for different parts which were very fascinating.
             Our group were missing some of the peices but we still had a lot of fun and learned a lot from dissecting a computer.

             My seventh week of engineering, we had a lecture on bio engineering which I thought was something that is very helful to our world. I thought
             the artfical heart was very cool because it can help so many people. Prosthetics was a big part of bio engineering as it lets both humans and 
             animals have a part of themselves that they were missing. Then we were challenged to make our own prosthetic hand that would lift a water 
             bottle. My group made our hand with 4 fingers and a thumb and we used strings and a rubber band to help pull the fingers together to grip the
             bottle. On thursday, we used tinkercad to make any prosthetic for an animal. I made a prosthetic tale for a dolphin for dolphins with amputated
             tales.

             In my seventh week of engineering, I learned a lot on aerospace engineering which encompasses the test of aircrafts such as rockets, spacecrafts, 
             missiles, and much more. Today, the focus of aerospace engineering revolves around the advancements of space exploration and defense systems. We 
             learn all this information from different forces to diffrent aerospace companies like Nasa. We also designed our own rocket on tinker cad for our 
             experiment with coke bottles which we have to make into rockets. I made my design pretty simple but made sure it had all the parts of a rocket.
             I learned a lot this week and can not wait to see the experiment next week.

             The ninth week of engineering was about areospace engineering. Aerospace engineering includes the use of designs for aircrafts like rockets,
             missiles, and spacecrafts. I also learned the four different types of forces which includes, weight, thrust, lift, and drag. Although i was absent
             when it was the day to build the rocket, i got to see us testing the coke bottle rockets which was super cool. Most of them flew upwards and barely 
             made it far but it was very interesting seeing how the different designs worked out.

             In my 10th week of engineering, I learned a lot about environmental engineering. I learned that it uses both science and engineering to improve the
             natural enviornment. Environmental engineering  provides fresh water, air, and land for all living organisms including us humans, animals, and plants. 
             By using this information we had a challenge to take dirty water and try to purify it to clean water by using materials like cotton balls, sand, pebbles,
             big rocks, and a coke bottle. My partner and I decided to layer the materials in the order of cotton balls on the bottom,sand, pebbles, then the big rocks.
             Our water wasnt super clear but it definitely got cleaner than before. It was very interesting to try and purify dirty water which is probably done every 
             second in this world to provide us with clean water to drink and use.

             <p>10/30-11/3 Week 11<br>
             This week in engineering, I learned about electrical engineering. Electrical engineering which is the field of engineering, and use of appliances and
             equipment which use any form of electricity is used in our world to create useful things such as automobiles and aircrafts. We were taught the different
             componets of circuits like resistors, capacitors, diodes, and much more. We also learned how to calculate how much current is flowing through the circuits
             by using the ohms law.  Then we were challenged to create specific circuit in series and parallel on tinkercad. Our goal was to get the LED light to turn
             on. Then we used multimeters to measure volts, amps, and ohms. I successfully turned the LED lights on by using my knowledge on electrial engineering that
             I learned this week.

             </p>11/6-11/10 Week 12<br>
             This week my partner and I worked on actual circuit labs. We worked hands on and used resistors and LEDs to create circuits in series and parallel. We were
             challenged to do many things such as making certain LEDs blink. We needed to code certain codes if we wanted certain LEDs blink and others not to blink using
             the website Arduino. Some challenges were difficult and we couldnt seem to get it to work but we talked it out and managed it to blink. I learned a lot this
             week such as working with my new partner and learning how circuits work.

             This 13th week of engineering, we talked about business engineering and how important this is for businesses to bloom. We talked about lots of different methods
             of business engineering like tiktok shop, mottos companies can use, etc. We used the idea of shark tank and was asked to come up with a product that will solve 
             a problem and present it like shark tank. My group and I started brainstorming ideas and decided to come up with a product that solves the trash problem in our 
             world. We came up with a trashcan that gives prizes when you throw away trash to help clean up the environment in a new, thrilling way.

             In my 14th week of engineering, we continued our shark tank project. We worked more on our pitch with my group and came up with more important ideas regarding 
             our trashcan. We discussed about our customers, money, and the future of our product, Magican. It was a product desgined to make throwing away trash more fun 
             to people so we can reduce waste. Our customers were the city districts with hope that they would put them out on the streets to further help the decrease in 
             trash. I think our product was a good idea because it can be a fun but also an effective way of helping our Earth.

             <li>The weight of our best spaghett bridge was 62 grams</li>
             <li>The weight held by the soaghetti bridge was 1483 grams</li>
             <li>The ratio of the weight of bridge to weight held by the bridge was 1:16.9032</li>
             <li>The heaviest part of our bridge was generally the middle part of the bridge. I think the layers of spaghetti we put to make it more secure contributed most of the weight </li>
             <li>My groups desgin came from the slides and a bit of research. We thought the triangular method from the truss bridge would be a good idea because it looked sturdy.</li>
             <li>The design of our bridge worked pretty well but worse than we expected because it did not carry as much weight as we wanted it to. We expected it to hold more weight since we used more than 1 piece of spaghettis glued together to make it thicker and more durable.</li>
             <li>The weakest point of our bridge was the right side of our bridge as it cracked little by little as more water was poured and eventually snapped. After reviewing the video, I can see that that was the expected weakest point since that was a part that broke off before and we glued back together. The part that broke also seemed to have less spaghetti layered on making it weaker and more breakable. We also realized that we put the bridge down upside down since we had made the bottom stronger than the top but accidentally put the weaker side on the bottom as the base for the rope to hang on. </li>
             <li>To improve our bridge I think we couldve stacked the spaghetti that we layered together as more of a bundle than glued flatly next to eachother to make it more stronger. Making the sides also thicker definitely would've prolonged the spaghetti bridge.</li>

             <p>Sem2 1/8-1/12 Week 1<br>
             My first week back from winter break, I learned about chemical engineering in my intro to engineering class. I learned from the
             presentation that chemcial engineering deals with chemical production and the manufacture of products through chemical processes. 
             Some fields of chemical enginnering are material science, metallurgy, and microfluidics. I think the most important thing i learned
             about was the distinction between a chemistry major and a chemical engineer. Although they sound like the same thing, it is important
             to know they are different as a chemistry major works with small amounts of materials at a lab while a chemical engineers works on 
             idustrial scale reactions with factory size equipments. Using this information, we did a mini experiement making oobleck. When making 
             oobleck, adding the water slowly and adding a little at a time was the key to making the perfect consistency. My making oobleck, I 
             learned a lot about chemical enginnering.

             <p>Sem2 1/15-1/19 Week 2<br> 
             This week we started our mousetrap car project. I chose to do the mechancial type of the mousetrap because i like to build more than
             electrical/coding. The first thing we were asked to do is create a project proposal. In the project proposal, I mostly worked on the 
             project research where I learned all the diffrent factors to get the most distance possible out of the mousetrap car. Some of the factors 
             where the length of the lever arm, the weight of the car, and the wheels. I learned that the lever arm should be long but not too long
             since it can weigh the car down, the car should be the lightest possible, and the wheels should be big because bigger wheels cover greater 
             distances than smaller wheels. My partner and I planned out a schedule of milestones that we can following when we begin building hands on.
             This project will help us learn more about machanical engineering and the basics of physics in a fun way.

             <p> Sem2 1/22- 1/26 Week 3<br>
             This 3rd week of second semester, we began to work on the desgin and the calculations of the ratio of axle to wheels. Although the calculations
             were a bit difficult for me, my partner helped a lot and we got it done. Our ratio of axle to wheels was 1:24 and our rod length was 12 inches. 
             With these calculations we expect a distance of 40 feet for our mousetrap car. After our calculations were done, I worked on the design using 
             tinkercad. I think building on tinkercad is finally getting easier for me as I designed the mousetrap car very easily and was very fun. For the 
             fourth week, we plan to actually start building hands on and I think we will start with the body of the mousetrap car as it is our base.

             <p> Sem2 1/29-2/2 Week 4  
             In our fourth week of engineering, we began building the car like we planned. We began on the body and cut each peices out of cardboard and assembled 
             them with hot glue. Then we hot glued the mousetrap to the body and worked on covering the holes of the CD with cardboard peices and tape. After working
             on the CDs, we started poking holes for the axle and put the CD through the axles. After we assembled the wheels we realized that it was very wobbly and
             it would not go anywhere in that state. We decided to use straws to help stablize and help the rotation of the axle and put littler holes in the cardboard 
             that is attached to the CD so it would be more secure on the axle. Next week we plan to start putting the string on the rod and testing it.

             <p> Sem2 Week 5(2/5-2/9) Week 6(2/12-2/19)
             We learned that our flaw in our design was that we put the axle through the bottom of our cardboard making the wheels very hard to stablize. We also figured 
             out that the hole we cutout to cover the CD hole was way to large, making more space for the axle to move which is why our wheels were unstable. 
             This was our biggest reason why our car did not go straight. We also had trouble with the fishing string because it kept untying at the tip of our rod and was 
             hard to roll around our axle and keeping it there without undoing by itself. This made it not go far as we planend to. In our second design, we will incoporate 
             the straw so the axle rolls better and put the axle right under our cardboard so the cardboard and wheels both have more stability. Our first car went 20 ft
             making our percent error 50%. Although our percent error was high, we were determined to make our 2nd desgin a hundred times better with no percent error. 
             For our second design we made the body for the car wider but kept it the same length and hot glued the straws under the cardboard for our axle. Then we covered
             the CD hole and poked the hole for our axle since that kept the hole size just right and not to big for the axle to move around. We hotglued the mousetrap then 
             hotglued the rod to the mousetrap and then tied the dental floss to the tip of our rod. We also cut out a hole in our cardboard so we can see the axle to wrap 
             the floss around. The next steps are to put a another layer of sturdy cardboard on top of the part we cut out because we found out that the pull of the mousetrap 
             caused the cardboard to bend.

             <p> Sem2 2/19 2/23 Week 7
             I think our testing went better as expected. Our second design worked very well, much better than our first design. Because our wheel was much more stable, and we 
             figured out how to wrap the floss around our axle, I did see what i expected which was a much greater distance than our first car. Our car traveled 40 feet which
             was exactly what we calculated which gives the percent error of 0%. If I had more time, I would make the length of both the rod and string longer so it has more 
             time to unravel giving us more length. Overall, I think we did well because our car improved going 20 feet more than our first car.

             For our new project, we started working on the design of the egg drop challenge. I came up with a design of like a cone using popsicle stick with a parachute using 
             a trashbag with the egg on a middle of a balloon which will be in the center inside the cone. Although its a complete new design, and im not a 100% it will work, 
             my partner and I are going to do our best to make it work. So far, we have built the base using cardboard and the cone using popsicle sticks which we tape 2 of them
             to increase the height of the cone. We also added the balloon to the center and added cotton balls surrounding the balloon. We were also challenged to debate over if 
             there are more doors or wheels on CV property. I was on team doors and our plan was to go split up and go around each building and count an estimate amount of doors
             and multiply it to the number of buildings at cv. We counted the doors using the definition we came up with whih is anything that rotates around an axis and gives you 
             access to something. Our final number was 22751 doors and we succeeded and won the debate.
