            8/21-8/24 Wekk 1<br>
             This first week of engineering i learned different rules on how to be safe to protect ourselves and others.I learned that<br> 
             safety goggles and putting your hair up is essential when working with equipments and tools.Today I learned how to work with<br>
             others to solve a problem. Our goal was to get a marble in a bucket but it was going too fast for us to control the marble.<br>
             By working together, we figured out we had straighted the stick so our marble's speed decreased. By doing that, our marble <br>
             went all the way passed the bucket. Now we had to figure out how to get the marble into the bucket which we almost figured <br>
             out by lowering our sticks.It was a great first week and I can not wait to learn more.<br>
